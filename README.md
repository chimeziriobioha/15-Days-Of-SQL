So, I'm taking a look at the language behind the ORM abstractions I've been using to work with databases all the while. That beautiful and very important `Structured Query Language - SQL`.

I employed the [15 Days of SQL](https://udemy.com/course/15-days-of-sql) course by [Nikolai Schuler](https://linkedin.com/in/nikolai-schuler) to guide me through it, and I'm putting it up here as a reference point for myself and anyone who may find it helpful.

The files inside the `/Commands` folder contain my learning practices ***from day-2-learning to day-15-learning***, going from simple to complex.

The `pagila-master.zip` and `flight_database.zip` files contain the SQL to build the databases used for the learning purpose. This is PostgreSQL based. The build can be done in PGAdmin's Query Tool by opening up and running `pagila-insert-data.sql` and `flight_database.sql` after extracting them from the zip files.

From `day 5 learning` up, the commands switch between the two databases multiple times in one file. This is something you can re-arrange by yourself if you find it annoying switching back and forth. I left it that way because that's the order in which I wrote the commands - which is progressive.
