I have acquired a crucial skill: **Structured Query Language (SQL)**, after relying solely on Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) in my previous projects.

To guide my learning, I completed the [15 Days of SQL](https://udemy.com/course/15-days-of-sql) course by [Nikolai Schuler](https://linkedin.com/in/nikolai-schuler). Iâ€™m sharing my journey and practices here as a reference point, both for myself and anyone who may find it helpful.

The files inside the `/Commands` folder contain my learning progress, ***from day 2 to day 15***, gradually moving from basic to advanced concepts.

The `pagila-master.zip` and `flight_database.zip` files include SQL scripts for building the databases used throughout the course. These are PostgreSQL-based, and you can build them in PGAdmin's Query Tool by running `pagila-insert-data.sql` and `flight_database.sql` after extracting the contents from the zip files.

Starting from `day 5`, the commands alternate between the two databases within the same file. If you find switching between databases inconvenient, feel free to reorganize the commands. I left them in the original sequence as that reflects the natural progression of my learning.
