# # # So, I decided to take a look at the language behind the ORM abstractions I've been using all the while. **The Structured Query Language, SQL**.

# # # I employed the [15 Days of SQL course](https://udemy.com/course/15-days-of-sql) by [Nikolai Schuler](https://linkedin.com/in/nikolai-schuler) to guide me through it.

# # # The files inside the `/Commands` folder contain my learning practices ***from day-2 to day-15***, going from simple to complex.
